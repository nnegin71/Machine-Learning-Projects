# Titanic - Machine Learning From Disaster
Using Random Forest Classifier to predict survival status of Titanic passangers

This project is one of the Kaggle competition projects, where some machine learning concepts such as train-test data split , one-hot encoding, and Random Forest tuning and evaluation are explored.

**Goal:**
Predicting survival status of Titanic passangers.â€¯ 

**Data Source:**
https://www.kaggle.com

#### Steps:
1. Loading and exploring data 
2. Creating feature-target sets
3. Initializing RandomForestClassifier from sklearn
4. Analyzing 5-fold cross-validation score
5. Splitting data inot train and cross-validation sets
6. Tuning the model
7. Evaluating feature importances
8. Evaluate prediction and generating output result
